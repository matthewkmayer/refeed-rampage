# refeed-rampage

Tracking refeed meals.

![Build](https://github.com/matthewkmayer/refeed-rampage/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

## What is this?

I tend to follow a cyclical ketogenic diet: low carbs six days a week and one refeed day a week that's high in carbs. The refeed day is also known as "rampage day" where *all the carbs* can be consumed.

This project is aimed at recording what I ate, how I liked it (will I eat the food again) and a general log on how I feel during/after the rampage.

## Goals

Modern web application with as little JavaScript as possible. The plan is to use Rust for the front and back end. This is meant to be a *usable* product so I can get a better understanding of WASM in production. Also: be inexpensive to run.

The site is deployed at https://rampage.screaming3d.com/ . (I knew keeping an awesome domain name around for so long would pay off.)

## Non-goals

I am not planning on:

* providing support for anyone else using this
* making this Amazon scale production ready
